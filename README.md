# CS310 Maze (Java)

### Warning!
If you are currently in Alan Riggins CS 310 class, please do not use this code. This is for two reasons:
- Professor Riggins often changes small aspects of the program to catch people attempting to do exactly this
- It defeats the purpose of actually taking the class, you will not learn anything from coping. 

### Project information
- Author: Andrew Black
- Class: CS 310
- Professor: Alan Riggins (San Diego State University)
- Purpose:
    - To create a Maze Solver implementing the previously created Linked List (LinearList.java)
    - To develop this class without using any prexisting data structure libraries

### How do I test the code?
Download the files in this repository and copy them into your working directory. Please make sure that the file structure is exactly the same as it appears in this repository, as most of the essential code is in the "data_structures" package. Test the code using the "MazeSolver.java" file as the main class file.
